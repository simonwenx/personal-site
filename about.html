        I'm Simon, a freshman pursuing computer engineering at Monroe Community College, located in Rochester, NY.
        Although I am relatively new to coding, I've grown proficient in langauges such as, Java, Python, Html, and Css respectively.
        With the second semester of my freshman year approaching, I'd love to become more involved in projects to gain real-world
        experience with programming and working as a team. What I love above all else is talking. I talk, talk, talk, whenever I 
        can—especially during times like these. This is what this page is meant for! If you're interested, be ready to bear with me 
        as I begin rambling on my roadmap that led to my enjoyment in coding!
        <br><br>
        When it comes to my interests, they span a wide spectrum. Ranging from video-games, reading, journaling, discovering new music and programming. 
        I spent most of my high school days buried in games like Clash Royale and Valorant—so much so to the point I had integrated game
        specific terms to my vocabulary. This honestly might qualify more as an addiction than just an interest!
        <br><br>
        Let's backtrack to the game I believed piqued my interest for coding, or at least problem solving. This would take us back to 2017, around the time I was in 5th grade.
        "Growtopia". To give some context, this game would essentially mimick concepts similar to real-world entrepreneurship. It would teach young
        kids about trust, cooperation, and growing capital. A reliable but inefficient way to gain capital in this game was called "farming". 
        Don't overthink about what this term could mean, because it literally meant to farm crops and blocks. It was to harvest trees and plant seeds.
        Although this process would guarantee risk-free returns in capital, this often took too long and many would come to realize it's resemblence 
        to a 9-5 job. Of course there were other ways to grow capital in this game, like running a business, or even reselling products,
        but nothing had risk-free returns like farming. Despite the fact that automatic farms already existed in the real world, the process had yet to be replicated
        in the game. This desire for more capital whilst saving time would embark an expedition to produce an automatic farm.
        At the ripe age of 10 I was introduced to high-levels of problem solving and this would carry on with me for the rest of my life.
        Being "rich" in this game felt like true freedom and I've lived under that consensus my entire life, to have money was to have freedom.
        Learning how to make money in this game sparked a deep passion for persistent problem solving and innovation.
        <br><br>
        I genuinely, genuinely, GENUINELY, 
        love conveniency. I love creating automatic functions that would complete a simple tedious task that would normally take up a fair amount of time.
        Nowadays, when I'm given free time, I could often be found reading, or spending time with family. If I'm not doing either
        of those things I would be programming. Often-times working I would be working on mini-projects to expand my understanding of commonly used languages like C++
        and Java. Recently I created a program with Java that would essentially transcibe a template of an email upon the user 
        typing in a key word such as "professor", or "casual". The program would essentially spit out a general email template that you
        would send to your professor in a professional manner, or even to a friend when the scanner reads "casual". As of now the program 
        still lacks accuracy. What do I mean by this? The program has a hard time understanding the way the user would normally 
        email their professor and therefore has a hard time writing up a template catering to the user's usual typing style. But then again,
        this program only serves for me and isn't nearly as completeted for public usage.
